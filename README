Building/installation:
sudo python setup.py install
If you prefer to have it cleanly removable, install checkinstall and run
sudo checkinstall python setup.py install

Use
There are currently 3 scripts in this package:
osmodumpdoc.py - dump documentation (the VTY's "show online-help").
osmotestconfig.py - test that apps start/write with example configs
osmotestvty.py - test vty operations (currently, tests very few)

Each of these scripts imports a project-specific osmoappdesc.py,
which provides information about the available apps, configs, vty ports, etc.

Run the scripts with osmoappdesc.py in the current directory (preferred)
or with -p <the directory containing osmoappdesc.py>.
Remember that osmoappdesc.py may contain relative paths.

Example:
After install osmodumpdoc for openbsc's apps can be run by:
cd <your_source_dir>/openbsc/openbsc && osmodumpdoc.py

Libraries:
osmopy/obscvty.py - connect to a vty, run commands on it, see the result 
osmopy/osmoutil.py - code that's shared between the scripts

obscvty.py may be of general use. osmoutil.py probably isn't.
